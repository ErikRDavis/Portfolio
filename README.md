## Welcome!

Hello, my name is Erik, and welcome to my portfolio! I am a Unity game developer with a passion for creating immersive gaming experiences. In my portfolio, you will find several projects that showcase my aptitude in the Unity game engine as well as my coding skills.

One of my most recent projects is called "Trebuchet". I developed it from scratch, including the design, coding, and art assets. It's not a fully fleshed out game, but it is more of a demonstration of a physics-based element that could be part of a full game.

Another project (2D-Character-Dialogue-System) I've included came from an evaluation for a Unity developer job opportunity. I enjoyed the challenge and the resulting project so much I needed to include here.

In addition to these projects, I am also working on a hobby project, VR archery game I plan to release in the not too distance future. I am skilled in C#, Unity scripting, and game design principles, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.

Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to contact me.
